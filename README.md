| **% Year**               | Unique Active Days / Days since Jan 1st            | Counts unique `date` values since January 1st of the current year.                |
| **Avg Workouts/Week**    | Total check-ins / Weeks since Jan 1st              | Uses total days since Jan 1st √∑ 7 to calculate weeks passed.                      |
| **Avg Active Days/Week** | Unique check-in days / Weeks since Jan 1st         | Same denominator as above, but with unique active days in the numerator.          |
| **Monthly Active Days**  | Unique days with check-ins per month               | Aggregated per calendar month using normalized `date`.                            |
| **Month Days**           | Number of days with at least one check-in in month | Only counts dates where data is available, not full calendar days.                |
| **Missed Days**          | Month Days - Monthly Active Days                   | Indicates how many days had no activity despite available data.                   |

| **Most Frequent Hour**   | Most common hour of check-ins                      | Based on mode of `created_at.hour`.                                               |
| **Avg Time/Workout**     | Mean of workout durations                          | Uses numeric `duration` field, converted if needed.                               |
| **Avg Calories/Workout** | Mean of calories per workout                       | Calculated only if the `calorias` column is present.                              |
